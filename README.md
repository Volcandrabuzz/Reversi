## Project: Reversi Game App

The Reversi Game App is a digital implementation of the classic Reversi (Othello) board game for Android devices. 
It offers users the opportunity to play against a computer opponent using a user-friendly interface. 
The app adheres to the official Reversi game rules, providing an engaging experience for players who enjoy 
strategic and tactical gameplay.

### Features:

- **Playable Reversi Game:** The app allows users to play Reversi against a computer opponent.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app features an intuitive and visually pleasing user interface, making it easy for players to interact with the game.
- **Game Logic:** The game logic is based on the official Reversi rules, ensuring an authentic and challenging experience.
- **Difficulty Levels:** The app offers eight difficulty levels for the computer opponent starting from Rookie to Grandmaster, allowing players to choose a suitable challenge level.
- **Game Statistics:** Players may be able to view game statistics, including the number of games played and won.

### Tech Stack Used:

- **Android Studio:** The app is developed using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- **Java** The primary programming languages for Android app development. Java is used to write the app's logic and functionality.
- **XML:** XML is used to define the app's user interface layout and design.
- **Canvas/Graphics:** The Canvas API is used to render the Reversi game board and pieces on the screen.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** To create the computer opponent, an AI algorithm such as the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is employed. This algorithm enables the computer opponent to make strategic moves based on potential future outcomes.
- **Version Control (Git/GitHub):** Version control is crucial for collaborative development. Git is used to track changes to the project, and GitHub are used to host the project repository.
- **Testing:** Unit tests and possibly instrumented tests are written to ensure the app's functionality works as intended.
- **Material Design:** Google's Material Design guidelines are followed to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface.

This Reversi Game App project showcases how Android Studio and a combination of technologies are used to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience. The app demonstrates key concepts in Android development, including UI design, game logic, 
AI integration, and database management.
